function [Px, Pxy] = ContactPressure(Fz, a, b, x, n, lambda, xe, One_D, y)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Help %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Description %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Calculates the contact pressure distribution using two shape parameters
% nl. n and lambda. Can be extended to 2D by supplying n and lambda for the
% y direction. For this one needs to have half the footprint width as a
% function of x and can be passed in through the 'w_x' parameter.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Variables %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Fz      := Vertical Force
%   a, b    := relative coordinate
%   A, B    := Regulation parameters ensuring boundary conditions are satisfied 
%   n       := shape parameter 1
%   lambda  := shape parameter 2
%   xe      := Distance from geometric centre to centre of pressure
%   w_x     := Half the footprint as a function of x
%   x, y    := Meshgrid of x and y values if 2D. Otherwise 1D array
